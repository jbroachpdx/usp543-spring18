# Course Concept

GIS is increasingly applied to all aspects of urban planning--far too
many to cover in 10 weeks! And, even if we had the time, I couldn't do
justice to the entire set of skills the field encompasses. With those
things in in mind, I treat this as an "emergent" course that tries to 
optimize the time we have given my knowledge and your existing skills and
interests. To paraphrase statistician George Box, "All courses are flawed, 
but some are useful."

This course is for students in planning and related fields who have already 
had a taste of GIS, or perhaps even a full serving or two, but find 
themselves hungry for more. Many will have had their basic training in a 
Desktop GIS, most likely ESRI's ArcMap, and will have mainly done "point and 
click" GIS analysis and map making. While that traditional setting is still 
common in planning, it is not the direction the field is headed. For that 
reason, this course is taught in a variety of software settings that 
emphasizes the dispersion of techniques, data sources, and applications in 
planning GIS.

The diligent student will leave the course with a diverse portfolio of GIS 
work to refer back to, build on, and to show potential employers. A useful 
way to define the field of urban planning is as an interdisciplinary 
response to city problems: inequitable access, environmental degradation, 
public health failures, inefficiencies, just to name a few. Many urban 
problems are "wicked" problems without a clear path to a solution, even if 
resources to tackle them were unlimited. Building a bridge may seem like a 
difficult problem, but deciding where to build it, and for whom, is many 
times harder. This course emphasizes the complexity and uniqueness of each 
urban problem by teaching students how to design tailored GIS applications, 
rather than simply running canned software tools.

Despite its complexity in application, GIS is conceptually pretty simple:  
define a spatial dimension of data, and consider based on one or more of the
following broad analysis types:

* *geometry*: shape/length/area 
* *pattern*: geographic distribution
* *overlay*: geographic relationship to other types of spatial features 
* *proximity*: degree of separation from other features of same or different 
  type

GIS also plays a key role in planning data collection--both quantitative and 
qualitative--and display, and we will spend some time on both of these 
dimensions as well.

# Tools & Skills

This is an applied course, and students will be introduced to a range of 
software tools, data types & sources, and analysis techniques. Mirroring 
the evolution of GIS planning practice, we'll work in a variety of 
software environments, each of which with its own particular strengths and 
limitations. We'll work with a wide variety of spatial data, and even 
generate our own. Wicked problems require flexible toolkits. In addition to 
the familiar ESRI/ArcMap formats, students will become familiar with:

* *Desktop GIS*: QGIS
* *Spatial Databases*: PostGIS, SpatiaLite
* *GIS Scripting/Programming Languages*: Python, PostGIS, R, ArcMap/QGIS Models
* *Data Sources*: GeoJSON, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Web Map Service
